# Twitch+BTTV Emote JSON Creator

Console application used to gather all Global Twitch emotes and all Global BTTV (Better Twitch TV) emotes, saves the relevant information for planned usage and concatonates them all into a list with converted values and (ideally) fixed URLs.

Channel based emotes currently being done through a separate class with sensitive information not being uploaded to the repository for security's sake.

After all emotes have been gathered, a JSON will then be saved to the downloads folder.

FFZ is planned but not yet implemented.
